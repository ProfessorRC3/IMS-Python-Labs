    "# Inference for categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `race_justice` dataset are the results from a Yahoo! News poll conducted by YouGov on May 29-31, 2020. In total 1060 U.S. adults were asked a series of questions regarding race and justice in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by a police officer. Results in this data set are percentages for the question, \"Do you think Blacks and Whites receive equal treatment from the police?\" For this particular question there were 1059 respondents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you'll be using the data from the poll to perform hypothesis tests using categorical data. This lab will make use of both simulations and mathematical models. This will allow you to compare the simulated distribution to the model's distribution. You will also be able to compare the results between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load packages\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab we will need the following packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import scipy.stats as st\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two new packages being used here, **scipy** and **numpy**. In this lab you will be constructing both simulations and models. These two packages will assist in the construction of the mathematical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a reproducible lab report\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using Jupyter notebook to create reproducible lab reports. Download the lab report template and load the template into Jupyter notebook. These templates can be used for each of the labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we are working with is in the race_justice.csv file. Download and load the data frame into **python**. The `race_justice` data frame has two variables `race_eth` and `response`. The `race_eth` variable is the self-reported race/ethnicity of the respondent, with levels `White`, `Black`, `Hispanic`, and `Other`. The `response` variable is the respondents answer to the question \"Do you think Black and White people receive equal treatment from the police?\", with levels `Yes`, `No`, and `Not sure`.\n",
    "\n",

    "<b>Exercise 1:</b> What do you expect to see in this data? Make some predictions about the statistics.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inference with a single proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "What percent of U.S. adults think Blacks and Whites receive equal treatment from police? You can attempt to answer this question using a confidence interval. In lab 5, you learned how to construct a bootstrapped distribution in order to create a confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Exercise 2:</b> Construct a bootstrap distribution using the variable name <code>bootstrap_dist_yes</code> in a histogram for the proportion of people who responded <code>yes</code> to the survey. Use this to find a 95% confidence interval.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the bootstrapped distribution to the mathematical model you will need to create a graph with both objects. The first piece of the puzzle is the bootstrap distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax = sns.histplot(data=bootstrap_dist_yes, bins=30, label='bootstrap distribution', stat='density')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to lab 5 where you created the multi-colored histogram with the vertical line at the observed value, here you are giving our histogram a variable name, `ax`, to superimpose different graphics on the same `plot`. There are a few additional parameters being used in the `histplot` function. The `label` parameter is giving the histogram a name for later reference. The `stat` parameter is scaling the histogram to the right size to fit with the mathematical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to add in the mathematical model. Assuming the conditions are met, the sampling distribution for a single proportion is nearly normal with mean $p$ and standard error of $\\hat{p}$ as $\\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}$. Let's get these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p_yes = race_justice['response'].value_counts(normalize=True)['Yes']\n",
    "SE = ((p_yes * (1 - p_yes))/len(race_justice))**0.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only new function here is `**` which is exponentiation. Since you are doing `**0.5`, you are raising the value to the `0.5` power, which is the same as taking the square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to create the graph of the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x0, x1 = ax.get_xlim()\n",
    "x_pdf = np.linspace(x0, x1, 100)\n",
    "y_pdf = st.norm.pdf(x=x_pdf, loc=p_yes, scale=SE)\n",

    "ax.plot(x_pdf, y_pdf, color='red', label='model')                                                   \n",
    "ax.legend()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this code is beyond the scope of this lab. The important pieces to understand are the parameters of the `st.norm.pdf` and `plot` functions. The `st.norm.pdf` function creates the y-values for the normal distrubtion using the mean `loc=p_yes` and the standard deviation `scale=SE`. The `ax.plot` function then draws the graph in the `color` red, to more easily distinguish the graph from the histogram, and `label`s the graph `model`.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",

    "You have the tools from lab 5 in order to perform the hypothesis test using simulation. Most of the code from the single proportion test above can be reused for the creation of the model. Since you are performing a hypothesis test for a difference in proportions, you will need to use $\\hat{p}_{pool}$ when computing the standard error. The equations are $$\\hat{p}_{pool} = \\frac{\\hat{p_1}n_1 + \\hat{p_2}n_2}{n_1 + n_2}$$ and $$\\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{pool}(1 - \\hat{p}_{pool})\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}$$ Computing these values individually will be easier.\n",

Expanding on that idea, are there differences in responses based on race and ethnicity? The $X^2$ statistic can be computed and a $X^2$ test performed to determine if there is evidence of a difference. First, you will need to compute the $X^2$ statistic. The formula for which is $$X^2 = \\sum \\frac{(\\text{observed count} - \\text{expected count})^2}{\\text{expected count}}$$ Computing $X^2$ by hand is exceedingly tedious.
