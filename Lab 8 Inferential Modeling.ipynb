    "The `sowc_demographics` data set is from UNICEF's State of the World's Children 2019 Statistical Tables. The data is broken down by country and contains a variety of statistics from each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you'll be using the data from the data set to perform inference on linear regression models. This will involve simulations using the randomization process and bootstrapping in order to compute p-values and confidence intervals. This will allow you to create different models and compute statistics in order to compare the models.\n",

    "The data we are working with is in the sowc_demographics.csv file. Download and load the data frame into **python**. The `sowc_demographics` data frame has eighteen variables. The description of each variable will be given at the end of this document for reference.\n",

    "A country's life expectancy seems to be a good predictor of their fertility in 2018. This model could be used as a way of estimating the fertility rate of a country knowing their life expectancy. By including more predictors, however, we might be able to create a more accurate model.\n",
