    "# Regression Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The Human Freedom Index is a report that attempts to summarize the idea of \"freedom\" through a bunch of different variables for many countries around the globe. It serves as a rough objective measure for the relationships between the different types of freedom - whether it's political, religious, economical or personal freedom - and other social and economic circumstances. The Human Freedom Index is an annually co-published report by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll be analysing data from the Human Freedom Index reports. Your aim will be to summarize a few of the relationships within the data both graphically and numerically in order to find which variables can help tell a story about freedom.\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore and visualize the data using **matplotlib.pyplot** and **seaborn** packages. You will also use the **pandas** package for handling data frames. The **sklearn.linear_model** package assists you in the computation of regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load the packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",

    "## Creating a reproducible lab report\n",
    "You will be using Jupyter notebook to create reproducible lab reports. Download the lab report template and load the template into Jupyter notebook. These templates can be used for each of the labs.\n",

    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data weâ€™re working with is called hfi, short for Human Freedom Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the hfi.csv file and load the data frame.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Exercise 2:</b> The dataset spans a lot of years, but we are only interested in data from year 2016. Filter the data <code>hfi</code> data frame for year 2016, select the six variables, and assign the result to a data frame named <code>hfi_2016</code>.</div>\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Exercise 3:</b> What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between the personal freedom score, <code>pf_score</code>, and <code>pf_expression_control</code>? Plot this relationship using the variable <code>pf_expression_control</code> as the predictor. Does the relationship look linear? If you knew a country's <code>pf_expression_control</code>, or its score out of 10, with 0 being the most, of political pressures and controls on media content, would you be comfortable using a linear model to predict the personal freedom score?</div>\n",

    "# The linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing a least squares line by hand is tedious. You can take advantage of the **sklearn.linear_model** package to do the computations for you. The package has a lot to offer, though you are only importing the function `LinearRegression`. This will suffice for your purposes. To use the function,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model_lr = LinearRegression().fit(hfi_2016[['pf_expression_control']], hfi_2016.pf_score)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the `LinearRegression()` function is being called to create the least squares line. The `fit()` function is applied to the model with the parameters `hfi_2016[['pf_expression_control']]` and `hfi_2016.pf_score`. The first parameter represents the x values for the model. The second parameter represents the y values. Notice that the formatting for these two parameters is slightly different. This is necessary because of the way the `fit()` function works. The reasoning is beyond the scope of this lesson, just recognize the different formatting. Finally, the model is stored in a new variable `model_lr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `model_lr` now holds all of the information we want regarding the linear model. Let's get the pieces of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"The slope for the model is\", model_lr.coef_[0])\n",
    "print(\"The y-intercept for the model is\", model_lr.intercept_)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can put this into the form of an equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"Regression Line Equation: Y = {model_lr.intercept_:.2f} + {model_lr.coef_[0]:.2f} * x\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the various elements of the model using the different extensions available. For example `.intercept_` will give the y-intercept of the model and `.coef_[0]` will give the slope (or coefficient) of the first input variable. If you wanted the slope for the second variable, you would use `.coef_[1]`. The third variable would be `.coef_[2]` and so on. Note that even though you only have one input variable now, namely `pf_expression_control`, you still need to include the `[0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formatting for the `print` function in the last line has two notable differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each variable is followed by `:.2f`. This tells python to only display 2 decimal places of the number in this variable. Typically with a linear regression model, two decimal places is sufficient accuracy.\n",
    "- The input for the `print()` function is using an f-string. Beginning the string with `f\"` allows for functional changes inside the string, namely the `:.2f` mentioned above. When using an f-string, you switch between variables using braces `{}` instead of commas `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful extension for the model is `.score`. You can use this extension to get the $R^2$ value for the model. Even though you already fit the $x$ and $y$ variables to the model, the `.score` function requires the $x$ and $y$ variables again. Thus, the syntax is\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model_lr.score(hfi_2016[['pf_expression_control']], hfi_2016.pf_score)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize the linear model on the scatterplot taking advantage of the `regplot` function in the **seaborn** package.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.regplot(x='pf_expression_control', y='hf_score', data=hfi_2016, ci=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `regplot` function works similarly to the `scatterplot` function. There is a new parameter, `ci=None`. The `regplot` function can also show a confidence interval around the linear model, though we will suppress that for now.\n",

When predictions are made for values of $x$ that are beyond the range of the observed data, it is referred to as extrapolation and is not usually recommended.

    "To assess whether the linear model is reliable, we need to check for (1) linearity, (2) nearly normal residuals, and (3) constant variability. In order to do these checks we need access to the fitted (predicted) values and the residuals.\n",

    "**Linearity**: You already checked if the relationship between `pf_score` and `pf_expression_control` is linear using a scatterplot. We should also verify this condition with a plot of the residuals vs. fitted (predicted) values.\n",

    "# Linear regression with multiple predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "The human freedom index measures a wide range of variables. It might be possible to construct a better model to predict `pf_score` using more than just `pf_expression_control`. Let's construct a model to predict `pf_score` using the two variables `pf_expression_control` and `pf_rol_criminal'. The code to create and evaluate the model will be roughly the same, though we are going to make use of a few more tools. To begin with, create a new data frame containing only the variables we are interested in.\n",
    "\n",

    "By using the `.filter` function, the new data frame `hfi_mult` only contains data for the three variables `pf_score`, `pf_expression_control`, and `pf_rol_criminal`. Check this using the `hfi_mult.head()` command. Notice anything in the data? Some of the data is listed as `NaN` which means that the data is missing. There are a variety of reasons why the data might be missing, though that is beyond the scope of this course. You will need to clean the data, essentially remove the rows that have missing data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "This line of code creates a new data frame, `hfi_mult_clean`, from `hfi_mult`. The difference is that all rows in `hfi_mult` that have missing data have been removed in `hfi_mult_clean`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now apply the same technique as before to create the linear model. This time, however, the input will be two variables instead of one. For simplicity, you will create a new variable `X` to represent the input variables. We can take advantage of the **pandas** function `.drop` to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mult_model_lr = LinearRegression()\n",

When you have many input variables, however, it will become cumbersome to write a line of code for each variable. Instead, you can use a `for` loop in **python**. A loop is a structure in coding that repeats code with potentially different values for each repeat. Let's see this in action.\n",

The function `enumerate(list(X))` takes the data frame `X` and considers only the names for the columns, which in this case will be `pf_expression_control`, `pf_rol_criminal`. The function outputs two values, the index of the column and the name of the column. By saying, `i, x in` you are storing the index and column name in the temporary variables, `i` and `x` respectively, each iteration through the loop. Finally, the `for` loop will run through each column present in the data frame `X`. The first iteration of the loop will have `i` be `0` and `x` be `pf_expression_control`. The second iteration of the loop will have `i` be `1` and `x` be `pf_rol_criminal`.\n",
    "- The second line of code is what will happen during each iteration of the loop. Notice that the code on this line is indented. This is how you indicate to **python** what should be included in the loop. In this case, `print` the string that includes the column name `x` and the slope of the regression model for the variable in the `i` index.\n",
